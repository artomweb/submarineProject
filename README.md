This is a submarine model that I designed for University project, we had only one week to create a working submarine model.

It draws water into a syringe to become more dense and sink, then expels it to rise to the surface.

I designed and animated the parts in Blender which were then 3D printed. The hull is an acrylic tube which is capped at either end.
